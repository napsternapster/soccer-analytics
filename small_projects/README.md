## Soccer Analytics

A repository for storing work I do in soccer analytics.
***

* **xg-monte-carlo.ipynb**: A Python version of an introductory R tutorial on Expected Goals and Monte Carlo Simulations.

* **bundesliga_xg**: Exploratory analysis on aggregated Bundesliga Expected Goals data. See the internal README for more info. One file contains my analysis and the other is some initial exploration plus some webscraping with RSelenium to collect more data. The RMarkdown file is also on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/gfleetwood/bundes-15-16-xg).

* **paulista_network_app**: A simple app melding Graph Theory and the reformed Campeonato Paulista. See app_intro.md in the folder for more details. The app itself is [here](https://gfleetwood.shinyapps.io/paulista_network_app/).

* **epl_1718_matchday_progression**: A bit of work inspired by this [tweet](https://twitter.com/Scribblr_42/status/962758232702844928).
