### Paulistao 2016 Group Stage Network

Brazilian football is known for its gimmicky tournament formats. Thus accustomed eyebrows were firmly rooted when the Campeonato Paulista's change from a single table to a convoluted group system in 2014. (That year's World Cup was the catalyst for the change to reduce the numbers of games in the tournament. The added complexity was completely unnecessary, though.) Instead of the usual 19 game first phase with teams playing each other once, four groups of five teams played against all others except those in their group. It's a completely bizarre setup from the usual soccer perspective. Mathematically, though, it's quite interesting. The format is analogous to a structure in Graph Theory called a complete k-partite graph. More specifically, it's a complete 4-partite graph of the form K<sub>5,5,5,5</sub> (four groups of 5). I wanted to recreate this structure since its inception, but I just recently acquired the skills and (even more recently) found the right package, visNetwork, to use.

Use the 'Select Network' drop down menu to look at the entire group stage or filter by a certain team. The 'Select by id' drop down highlights a team within a selected network. Hovering over an edge will show the matchday, participating teams, and scoreline. The green navigation buttons facilitate easier visual parsing. Finally, here is a link to the [code](https://github.com/gfleetwood/soccer-analytics/tree/master/paulista_network_app).
