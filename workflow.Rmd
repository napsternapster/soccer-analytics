## Cribsheet

* [Opta Data Schema](http://www.soccermetrics.net/match-data-collection/the-opta-data-schema-an-introduction)

* [Opta Event Definitions](http://optasports.com/news-area/blog-optas-event-definitions.aspx)

* Average percentage of goalscoring shots on target taken that end up as goals: 31%. 

* Average percentage of goalscoring shots on target taken that end up as goals: 10.5% (Anything outside 7-12% will pretty much certainly not last - eventually)

* Shots: At least 3.5 shots per 90 is typically good. Over 4 or 4.5 is pushing toward elite.

* Previous research shows that a shot without defenders between the goal and ball goes in 11.59% on average vs 7.49% if defenders are present.

* A fairly simple guideline for non-penalty scoring rates as a Forward:

    * .4 to .49 non-penalty goals per 90: Good.
    * .5 to .59 non-penalty goals per 90: Very good.
    * .6 to .79 non-penalty goals per 90: Probable Top 20 in Europe
    * .8 or above non-penalty goals per 90: Probable Top 5 in Europe
